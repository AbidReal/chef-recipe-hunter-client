* The design of this website is also unique as there was no reference figma file to design on. This website represents the design sense of the front end developer who is not an ui/ux designer.
* This website has a chefs section with 6 chefs in it. And if you click their recipe, you will be redirected to a privateRoute which can only be accessed by logging in. That page has a banner of the chef and cards with his dishes.
